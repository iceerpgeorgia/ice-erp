# Files to Remove (Duplicates)

The following files are duplicates/exports that are no longer needed:

❌ CODEX_SHARE.md (duplicate - marked as deleted)
❌ COUNTRIES_TABLE_EXPORT.md (duplicate - marked as deleted) 
❌ EXPORT_PACKAGE.md (duplicate - marked as deleted)
❌ COMPLETE_COUNTRIES_TABLE_FOR_CODEX.tsx (same code now in components/countries-table.tsx)

These files were created during the export process but are now redundant since:
1. The main documentation is in COMPLETE_CODEX_EXPORT.md
2. The working code is in components/countries-table.tsx
3. The design specs are in DESIGN_SYSTEM_DELIVERABLES.md

I cannot directly delete files, but these should be removed from the project to clean up the structure.
