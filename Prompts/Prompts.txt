#Payments Report Conditions Button
In payments report I want to have filter by  condition button named "Conditions". Options must be ALL,Accrual>0(sum aggregated accrual>0),Order>0,Accrual<0,Accrual=0,Order>0,Order<0,Order=0,Paid>0,Paid<0,Paid=0,Due>0,Due<0,Due=0,Balance(Current balance)>0,Balance<0,Balance=0,Due(Current due)>0,Due<0,Due=0. I want this options to have checkboxes and by default all of them should be checked. If user makes any modification to the selection the browser should remember that selection and replicate the selection next time he opens browser. Report should fetch by default (ALL option) all payments which including those which does not have any record in Payments Ledger or Bank Transactions.

#Payments Report Statement edits
In payments report when I open statement for the payment in the statement I want accrual and/or order rows to have edit functionality from report. In this case if I select it I should have option to edit the record. User should be able to payment_id,date,accrual or order sum and comment of the record. If payment_id is changed the record should appear with all payment_ID related fields in accordance to changed new Payment_ID (so maybe here we use trigger in payments ledger table to reparse fields according to edited payment_ID).

In edit dialogue I want to have combobox with payment_id search functionality like we got in add Payments Ledger record. However under this combobox we must have parameters of payment id dynamically exposed like in + action dialog in payments reports page. If user changes payment id all payment id related fields should be refetched according to changed payment_id. Make the dialog 896px wide and add confirmation message with visually recognizable change report. The change report visualization must be in the confirmation prompt if I hit save changed. Make the statement updated if the record is changed, but not all the page should reloaded, but only updated and recalculated if the record changes.And if it's possible the change done from statement edit dialog to replicate on opened payments report page. In statement instead of values 0.00 use blank in Accruals, Orders and Payments column only space and add totals to the grit so we see total accrual, total order total payment and total PPC


# import_bank_xml_data.ts right which works parsing logic for old bog_raw table? In that script I want to add following: for parsing purposes when the data is fetched from salaries accrual payment ids before joining it with payments it would be appropriate not to fetch all the orders. So we have payment id's like NP_ce3eb6_NJ_a34590_PRL122025 with NP_ce3eb6_NJ_a34590 being unique for counteragent+financial code combination across any timeframe which is denominated with expression _PRL122025. So if in Dec 2025 this payment id is NP_ce3eb6_NJ_a34590_PRL122025 and in Jan 2026 it is NP_ce3eb6_NJ_a34590_PRL012026 right. So for parsing (at least for payment_id related fields - counteragent, financial code) only left part NP_ce3eb6_NJ_a34590 should be taken. So basically we take =unique(left(salary_payment_ids_in_salaries_accruals_base,20))to parse salary payments with payment id like NP_ce3eb6_NJ_a34590_PRL012026, if it's left 20 symbols match =ArrayFormula(unique(left(salary_payment_ids_in_salaries_accruals_base,20)) then matching payment id can be said that is done,  just verify that the rightmost expression of _PR122025 can be matched to the valid period, like in _PR122025 12 = December and 2025 = year 2025 and if it is valid fix the record payment id  which represents it's parsing source, even if it is not given directly in salary accruals. This means that in salary accruals maybe the latest month will be _PR122025 or December 2025, but maybe the bank xml will have NP_ce3eb6_NJ_a34590_PRL012026, the payment id which's left 20 is in our salary accruals column left 20 , that makes it possible to parse payment id related fields and fix the records payment id as NP_ce3eb6_NJ_a34590_PRL012026. And one more cherry on top, if we have typos in bank statement field from where the payment ID is delivered and for example have NP_ce3eb6_NJ_a34590_PRL002026, which's period denominator _PRL002026 can not be assigned to any month as 00 can not be any month, the period part in this payment id for this record should be changed into next month of the latest month currently existing in salary accruals. So like if in Salary Accruals we have latest month of Dec 2025 the payment id with typo like NP_ce3eb6_NJ_a34590_PRL002026, NP_ce3eb6_NJ_a34590_PRL132026,NP_ce3eb6_NJ_a34590_PRL,NP_ce3eb6_NJ_a34590 should be set as NP_ce3eb6_NJ_a34590_PRL012026.

# Salaries Accrual Future Salaries Emulation

In salaries accruals page I want to have selection of projected months count. That should be selection of integer. So purpose of this selector is to replicate the latest months records exactly as they are, but with change of the period only. So let's say I have set this selector to 36, and the latest salaries accruals period is Dec 2025 and it has 80 records with this period, I want the page to replicate all this 80 records, for next 36 months with change of time period of course. So I can see if we have some payments in bank transactions which are linked to this future salaries accruals. The parameter selector should be saved by browser and next time user reopens the page he should see it


In salaries accrual page while building the script should rep
